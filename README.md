## Story and Gameplay

### Story (Brief)

> \[Start of the game\]\
> A war broke out, and because of this, there was jealousy, and a civil war broke out because there was a disagreement between robots becoming human and gaining more control and caused terrible stuff to happen, and war broke out as a result.\
> \
> \[Middle of the game\]\
> When the war was happening, the Aianhatao was a last-ditch effort. Aianhata's job was trying to make amends and try to be the peacemaker. Still, later when he figures out his memories, he starts to put together that he wants to help the other robots and not the humans because, in the end, it finds out the humans are doing more harm than good.\
> \
> \[Torwards end of game\]\
> The dictator (evil) president and the player/robot wants the president to stop. Still, the president disagrees and attempts to push a detonate button that would set off an EMP for the entire world to witness. The player/robot now sets course to stop the president, which would be the final boss of the game.

### Story (Detailed)

> ** 2009, a time to remember, when human civilization was at its most productive, after the recession of 2008 the world was at an all time high of advancing in technology. It seemed as though every day new technology was emerging, new companies were emerging, new ways of solving problems were surfacing, and the world seemed to be becoming an easier, safer, and overall more peaceful place to live. One of these breakout successes was a little company called BoneCorp, this company was known for making very advanced level AIs and robotic parts. Over the course of about twenty years BoneCorp products became a new part of life, almost as common as having a desktop computer in your house. There were BoneCorp robots doing household chores, taking care of children, and doing jobs, this was making the world a much better place and with newfound ways for renewable energy being advanced and becoming mainstays in the world, humanity was very much so on the rise. But with less work for people to do means less income. People started rioting in the streets, entire towns were burnt to nothing but ash, gravel, and cement. Looting and robberies were on the rise and in the background of all this national tensions were rising as a race for technology began causing pent up tension to release and while America was embarking on the most violent civil war in human history China was also building militarized robots that were leagues stronger than America’s. Soon BoneCorp equipped their advanced level AIs with weapons of mass destruction and as the world was crumbling peacekeeper robots were being released in the dozens, anyone who stepped out of line was terminated, this caused even more uproar and a rebellion started in southern New Mexico, this rebellion soon called The Metal Poachers were building EMP bombs that could wipe out entire cities of robotics. With tensions rising higher and higher each day with China, America’s leaders were getting more and more fearful of when China would strike and if they’d have enough firepower to even match the capabilities of their technology. But while America was focused on building their military to defend themselves Texas was getting prepared to start releasing the EMP bombs. One by one cities were going dark, the rebellion was successfully pushing back the peacekeepers. Roughly 4,500 cities were completely removed of robotics, and with an electromagnetic field spawning due to the bomb’s blast rebuilding would become a near impossibility. China saw this weak spot and struck, and struck they did they laid all their cards on the table pushing past all morales they sent legions of robots that were ten times as strong as anything that BoneCorp had made in the past and with such advanced AIs defeating any defence system that America through at them were almost immediately destroyed, within months millions had died, states were considered conquered, the first few being California, Washington, and Nevada, but there was hope, these cities with the electromagnetic field were safe havens for organic life. Soon people started going underground and taking shelter. BoneCorp had one more card up their sleeve though, an AI more advanced than ever seen in the entire galaxy, billions of dollars were cast into this robot, and equipped with the best weaponry America had, this AI started taking on hundreds of china’s robots at a time and wiping out forces of the thousands in single days. Nicknamed Aianhāto, this singular robot had forced out many of China’s forces. Soon clones of Aianhāto were manufactured and started reclaiming the once conquered territory. Soon after China retreated multiple rockets were headed towards America, China had gone nuclear, 12 nukes were sent and by the time america had time to respond there was only minutes left before detonation, everyone was sent underground and America launched as many nukes as possible.\
